## Designing a customer Beamer theme from scratch
This repository represents my efforts to [Design a custom Beamer theme from
scratch](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146529/design-a-custom-beamer-theme-from-scratch#146682).
I was inspired by a [tex.stackexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146529/design-a-custom-beamer-theme-from-scratch#146682)
post I read, and the examples provided.  [beamerports](ttps://bitbucket.org/marczellm/beamerports/src/master/)
also implemented two examples based on the post.

## My Goal
Design the 'Havasu' Beamer theme to mimic my employer's standard presentation
format.  I am using my employer's format because each page has:
1. Company logo is placed in the upper right-hand corner,
2. Horizontal line graphic,
3. Vertical line graphic, and
4. a different graphic is used on the title page.
